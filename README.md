# Real-Time Intrusion Detection System using ML and Scapy

This is a real-time intrusion detection system that uses machine learning (Isolation Forest) and packet sniffing (via Scapy) to monitor and detect anomalous IP behavior on the network.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time packet sniffing using `Scapy`
- IP-level anomaly detection using Isolation Forest (unsupervised ML)
- Alerts and notifications for suspicious activity
- GUI support for normal and alert states

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Scapy (for packet sniffing)
- Scikit-learn (for Isolation Forest)
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Winsound (for alert sound)
